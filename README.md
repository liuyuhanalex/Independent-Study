## Cycle GAN Structure
![Structure Image]()

## Web Application
The application based on the model can be found [here](https://www.tianlaivc.com/)


## Task List
- [x] Extract vocal from the music
- [x] Remove slience part,segment and reformat the music
- [x] Training the model using original CycleGAN model
- [x] Create a demo web application
- [ ] Noise reduction of the converted sound segment using ML
- [ ] Improve the performance of the CycleGAN using Res2Net block
- [ ] Try many-to-one sound conversions with other models
